# The Black Company Book Series

Those that know me are aware that I'm a book afcionado.
I spend most of my free time reading, especially during my commute to work. That allows me to read a good quantity of books through the year and to keep my mind fresh.  
Recently I've been reading (and listening to the audiobooks too) the masterpice of Gleen Cook, The Black Company.  
This is a dense series of books, it consists of 11 books and the most recent one was released at the end of 2018.  
The series is about a group of mercenaries that travel across a world where magic exists but is not accessible to most of its people. The mercenaries are bounded by contract to obey their employers and that means doing things that they wouldn't want to or don't agree with.  
The adventures are described by the view of one of the soldiers, at least for the most of the series. In that, we follow Croaker while he describes his view of humanity, and it is a raw vision, totally bare of romanticism.
